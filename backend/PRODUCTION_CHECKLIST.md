- [ ] All packages installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] PyTorch CPU version working
- [ ] Transformers library accessible

### 2. Environment Setup
- [ ] `.env` file created (copy from `env.template`)
- [ ] Port 8001 available
- [ ] Directories created: `data/`, `logs/`
- [ ] Sufficient disk space (~1GB for models)

### 3. Model Verification
- [ ] Emotion classifier loads successfully
- [ ] First message processes without errors
- [ ] Memory persistence working
- [ ] Crisis detection functional

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
python start_production.py
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Verify Integration
- [ ] Frontend loads at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Backend responds at http://localhost:8001
- [ ] Chat functionality works
- [ ] Emotion detection active
- [ ] Crisis detection working

## üîç Health Checks

### Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

### API Documentation
- [ ] Swagger UI accessible at `/docs`
- [ ] All endpoints documented
- [ ] Request/response examples working

### Chat Endpoint Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/chat/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I am happy today!", "user_id": "test"}'
```

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Memory Usage
- [ ] Peak RAM usage < 6GB
- [ ] Stable memory after initialization
- [ ] No memory leaks during chat

### Response Time
- [ ] First message: < 5 seconds
- [ ] Subsequent messages: < 500ms
- [ ] No timeouts or hanging requests

### Error Handling
- [ ] Graceful fallback if model fails
- [ ] Proper error messages
- [ ] No crashes on malformed input

## üîí Security Verification

### Input Validation
- [ ] Malicious input rejected
- [ ] SQL injection attempts blocked
- [ ] XSS attempts sanitized

### CORS Configuration
- [ ] Frontend can access backend
- [ ] Unauthorized origins blocked
- [ ] Credentials handled properly

### Data Protection
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Memory files properly secured
- [ ] No external API calls

## üìà Production Readiness

### Scalability

- [ ] No bottlenecks identified

### Reliability
- [ ] 24/7 operation capability
- [ ] Graceful error recovery
- [ ] No data loss on restart

### Monitoring
- [ ] Health endpoint responsive
- [ ] Log files accessible
- [ ] Performance metrics available

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port conflicts**: Check `netstat -ano | findstr :8001`
2. **Memory issues**: Close other apps, check Task Manager
3. **Model loading**: Verify internet connection and disk space
4. **CORS errors**: Check frontend URL in config

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Server crash**: Restart with `python start_production.py`
2. **Memory overflow**: Restart server, check for memory leaks
3. **Model corruption**: Delete model cache, restart server

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Chatbot responds to all emotion types
- [ ] Crisis detection triggers appropriately
- [ ] Memory persists across restarts
- [ ] Frontend integration seamless
